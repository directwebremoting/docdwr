<h1>Supported Environments</h1>

<p>DWR requires JDK 1.3 or later and a servlet engine that supports servlet spec version 2.2 or later. Earlier versions of the servlet spec may also work.</p>

<p>It is regularly tested in many operating environments including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tomcat</li>
<li>Weblogic</li>
<li>Websphere</li>
<li>JBoss</li>
<li>Jetty</li>
<li>Resin</li>
<li>Sun ONE</li>
<li>Glassfish</li>
</ul>

<p>In version 1.0 we only know of 2 environments where DWR may cause problems. DWR fails when your app-server is fronted by a web server that alters URLs in a way that the app-server is not expecting and there may be some issues running with DWR in Vignette portal.</p>

<p>All other tested environments that DWR has been tested in seem to be running just fine.</p>
