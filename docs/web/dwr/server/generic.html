<h1>Reading from other URLs</h1>

<p>If you need to read HTML pages generated by other web applications and return them to Javascript, you can quite simply.</p>

<p>Just include the following method in some Java class that is exported using DWR:</p>

<pre>
public String getInclude() throws ServletException, IOException
{
    return WebContextFactory.get().forwardToString("/forward.jsp");
}
</pre>

<p>Obviously you should replace <code>"/forward.jsp"</code> with the URL that you wish to forward to. The URL will need to start with a slash since this is just calling <code>HttpRequest.forward()</code> under the covers.</p>

<p>You can use this method to customize the page before you pass it on if you wish.</p>
