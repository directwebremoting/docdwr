<h1>Contributors</h1>

<p>DWR was invented by <a href="http://directwebremoting.org/blog/joe/">Joe Walker.</a></p>

<p>The current maintainers are:</p>

<ul>
<li>David Marginian</li>

<li>Mike Wilson</li>



</ul>

<p>There are some <a href="contract.html">'rules' for contributors</a>. They're not onerous, but are designed to help us develop in harmony.</p>

<h1>Getting Involved</h1>

<p>We are always on the lookout for more help. If you want to get involved, you should do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Join the <a href="../../support/index.html">mailing list</a>. It's probably best to join dwr-users and dwr-dev.</li>
<li>Get involved by helping users, and seeing how we do things.</li>
<li>Experiment with DWR and see if there is any area you are particularly interested in.</li>
<li>Get an account in our <a href="https://directwebremoting.atlassian.net/secure/Dashboard.jspa">bug tracking system</a>, and either find an issue to work on, or create an issue.</li>
<li>Post to dwr-dev with what you are wanting to change to make sure it doesn't clash with some other work.</li>
<li>Make the changes and send a zipped patch to the mailing list describing what you've changed.</li>
<li>It's not worth applying through java.net for developer status, that method of getting involved doesn't work properly ,and requests always end up getting denied.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a number of existing DWR components that we are looking for maintainers for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dojo Integration</li>
<li>The Fluent Configuration System</li>
<li>Guice</li>
<li>The Demo Webapp</li>
</ul>



<p>There are a number of areas of DWR that could do with improvement:</p>

<ul>
<li>Integration with other Ajax toolkits: Dojo, YUI, etc</li>
<li>Demo apps that show integration with: Spring, Struts, Webwork, etc</li>
</ul>

<p>And it's always good to have people that are keen on writing documentation or helping with sending out release announcements.</p>
