<h1>Commercial Support</h1>

<a href="http://sitepen.com/services/support.php"><img src="http://getahead.org/images/sitepen-logo.png" style="padding-left: 10px; float: right;"></a>
<p>SitePen can provide a number of support packages to help you with
Ajax/DWR development.</p>

<p>The three primary benefits of our support packages include:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Unlimited advice for your designated team members for questions
about best practices, approaches, etc.</li>
  <li>A set number of hours dedicated to fixing problems you have
either with DWR itself, or your use of DWR.</li>
  <li>priority support to get a solution to your problem right away.</li>
</ul>

<p>For information about commercial support, please <a href="http://sitepen.com/services/support.php">contact us</a>. If you
have questions about DWR please don't send them to the authors
directly. There are far more people that can help on the mailing lists,
so you'll get a faster response that way.</p>
