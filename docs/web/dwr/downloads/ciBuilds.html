<h1>Continuous Integration Builds</h1>

<p>We use Atlassian Bamboo for continuous integration builds.  Each time code is checked into trunk a new build is initiated.  The code on Bamboo is always the most current.  You are free to download these builds from our <a href="http://ci.directwebremoting.org/bamboo/" target="new">Bamboo server</a>.  However, <b>please remember that these are development</b> builds and may be broken or not fully tested.</p>
