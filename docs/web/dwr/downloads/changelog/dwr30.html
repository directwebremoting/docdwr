<h1>DWR version 3.0 RC1</h1>

<p>The much awaited DWR version has reached release candidate 1. What&#39;s new?</p>

<ul>
<li>RPC Enhancements<ul>
<li><strong>Varargs</strong> support</li>
<li><strong>Method overloading</strong> (DWR tries to copy Java&#39;s method matching rules)</li>
<li><strong>Typed parameters</strong> (so you can say <code>new Apple()</code> in JavaScript and pass it to the <code>addFruit()</code> method and DWR will instantiate the correct type on the server)</li>
<li><strong>Lightweight typed parameters</strong> (as above, but by adding <code>$dwrClassName:&quot;Apple&quot;</code>, for when you are getting the objects from something else)</li>
</ul>

</li>
<ul>
<li>More <strong>natural synchronous XHR</strong> (so you can call <code>var reply = Remote.getData()</code> when doing &#39;Sjax&#39;)</li>
</ul>

<li>Improved Marshalling<ul>
<li><strong>Binary file upload/download</strong> (<code>byte[]</code>, <code>java.awt.BufferedImage</code>, <code>InputStream</code> etc and <code>FileTransfer</code> can be uploaded from an <code>input type=file</code>, offered for download, or sent to an <code>img</code>)</li>
</ul>

</li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Locale, Currency</strong> (DWR will marshal to and from <code>java.util.Locale</code> and <code>java.util.Currency</code> objects)</li>
</ul>

<li>Reverse Ajax<ul>
<li>More <strong>scalable Reverse Ajax APIs</strong> (See <code>org.directwebremoting.Browser</code>)</li>
<li><strong>DOM Manipulation</strong> Library (<code>Window</code> and <code>Document</code> can now be manipulated from the server)</li>
<li>The server now runs in <strong>3 modes</strong>: stateless (New - save memory with no page tracking), passiveReverseAjax (the default) and activeReverseAjax (comet enabled)</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Over the wire<ul>
<li><strong>JSONP</strong> support</li>
<li><strong>JSON-RPC</strong> support</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Tech Previews<ul>
<li><strong>JMS</strong> Integration (Publish to the browser directly from JMS)</li>
<li><strong>Jaxer</strong> Integration (Zero configuration for trusted environments)</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Infrastructure<ul>
<li><strong>SVN</strong> (We&#39;ve moved from CVS to SVN)</li>
<li><strong>Related Projects</strong> (Our repository contains a set of related projects including a number of demos)</li>
</ul>

</li>
<ul>
<li><strong>CLA</strong> (We&#39;ve been through a legal review and have signed CLAs for dwr.jar)</li>
<li><strong>Dojo Foundation</strong> (We joined the Dojo Foundation and are now hosted by their servers)</li>
<li><strong>Better Documentation</strong> (DWR version 1.x had great docs. Version 2.x let things slide a bit, but we&#39;ve dropped Drupal, and have our own system now)</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p>There are also a bunch of things like better logging, error reporting and so on, but the full list would get quite dull. 2 things dropped out that we'd previously talked about: Bayeux Support and Gears Offline integration. We&#39;ll get to those, particularly Gears, soon.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there will be lots of questions about how to use these features. Please don&#39;t ask in the comments. Join the <a href="../../support/index.html">mailing list</a> and ask there. As we roll out the new documentation system in the next week or so, all the details will be in there, and I&#39;ll then come back and link up this blog post.</p>

<p>You can <a href="../../downloads/index.html">download it now</a>.</p>
