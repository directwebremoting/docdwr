<h1>Commercial Support</h1>

<p>We can provide a number of support packages to help you with Ajax/DWR development.</p>

<p>The three primary benefits of our support packages include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unlimited advice for your designated team members for questions about best practices, approaches, etc.</li>
<li>A set number of hours dedicated to fixing problems you have either with DWR itself, or your use of DWR.</li>
<li>priority support to get a solution to your problem right away.</li>
</ul>

<p>For information about commercial support, please 
<script type="text/javascript">
var lt = String.fromCharCode(60);
var gt = String.fromCharCode(62);
var b = "" + lt + "a href";
var f = "/a" + gt;
var c = "'mail";
var h = "to:";
var k = "kim";
var g = "getahead";
var m = "mailhost";
var u = ".co.uk";
var i = ".org'";
var j = "support";
var a = b + '=' + c + h + j;
var d = g + i + gt + "contact us" + lt + f;
document.write(a + '@' + d);
</script>
<noscript>contact us using [support at getahead dot org]</noscript>. If you have questions about DWR please don't send them to the authors directly. There are far more people that can help on the mailing lists, so you'll get a faster response that way.</p>

<h1>Mailing lists</h1>

<p>Most of these mailing lists are hosted by java.net. You can join Java.net by <a href="https://www.dev.java.net/servlets/Join">registering here</a>, and then you can <a href="https://dwr.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">subscribe</a>. However, you should not need to subscribe to take part - web interfaces are available.</p>

<h2>DWR-Users Mailing List</h2>

<p>The users mailing list is where the vast majority of discussion about DWR takes place. You can send email to the list directly using: [users at dwr.dev.java.net], or you can access the list on the web:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://dwr.dev.java.net/servlets/SummarizeList?listName=users">Java.net archive of DWR-Users</a></li>
<li><a href="http://dwr.2114559.n2.nabble.com/DWR-Users-f2114559.html">Nabble archive of DWR-Users</a></li>
<li><a href="http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.java.dwr.user">GMane archive of DWR-Users</a></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="security">DWR-Security</a></h2>

<p>The idea behind the dwr-security mailing list is that we should have a way to discuss DWR security while minimizing the dangers associated with wide public dissemination. The list is not about keeping problems secret forever, but it is about responsible disclosure.</p>

<p>Just to be clear: dwr-security is NOT another option for getting support when something doesn't work.</p>

<p><strong>Membership rules</strong>: Since dwr-security is about responsible disclosure, we would like to know who the members are. Almost everyone wants to subscribe from a gmail or similar web-based address. That's OK, but we want to link web addresses to some type of corporate address OR have some other way of positively identifying you.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you are subscribing using a corporate email address, please make sure we know your full name and job title in the request.</li>
<li>If you are subscribing using a web-based email address, please apply in the same way but also send an email from your corporate address to [joe at getahead dot org] at the same time.</li>
<li>If you don't have a corporate email address, please find some other way to identify yourself to us.</li>
</ul>

<p>Applications to join can be <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/dwr-security">made using Google Groups</a>.</p>

<p>Anyone can post to the list using the address: [dwr-security at googlegroups.com]. You don't need to be a member to post to the list.</p>


<h2>DWR-Development</h2>

<p>Discussion list for DWR development. Currently most discussion takes place on the users mailing list, however this list may become more used in the future. The email address for the list is: [dev at dwr.dev.java.net], or, on the web:</p>

<ul>
