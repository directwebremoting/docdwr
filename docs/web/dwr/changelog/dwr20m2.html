<h1>DWR version 2.0 milestone 2 is released.</h1>

<p>We're on a roll ...</p>

<p>Milestone 1 delivered <a href="dwr20m1.html">Reverse Ajax and other goodies</a>. Milestone 2 adds Annotations, Reverse Ajax using <a href="http://jetty.mortbay.com/jetty/index.html">Jetty</a> Continuations, the ability to write your Javascript in Java and more.</p>

<!--break-->

<h2>Write your Javascript in Java</h2>

<p>Javascript puts some people off Ajax; DWR 2.0 milestone 2 has a set of new experimental APIs that allow you to use Java and the familiarity of the language and IDE to write Javascript.</p>

<p>The first is a server-side version of our own DWRUtil library:</p>

<pre>
import org.directwebremoting.proxy.dwrutil.DwrUtil;

DwrUtil util = new DwrUtil(...);
util.addOptions("selectId", array);
</pre>

<p>The code above is Java, but it alters what is seen in a remote web browser, in this case by adding the contents of a string array into a drop-down list.</p>

<p>We also have an experimental server-side Java version of <a href="http://script.aculo.us/">Script.aculo.us</a> <a href="http://github.com/madrobby/scriptaculous/wikis/core-effects">Effects</a>:</p>

<pre>
import org.directwebremoting.proxy.scriptaculous.Effect;

Effect effect = new</span> Effect(...);
effect.fade("selectId");
</pre>

<p>The really neat thing is that you can combine these server-side APIs with Reverse Ajax to alter many browsers with a few calls.</p>

<pre>
Collection sessions = WebContextFactory.get().getScriptSessionsByPage("/index.html");
DwrUtil util = new DwrUtil(sessions);

util.setValue("message", "Hello, World!");
</pre>

<p>This code will find all the browsers on the home page and alter the contents of a div with id="message" to contain a greeting. There is an example of this working in the Java Chat example included in the war file download. You can also <a href="http://fisheye5.cenqua.com/viewrep/dwr/demo/uk/ltd/getahead/dwrdemo/chat/JavaChat.java?r=1.1">view the source using FishEye</a>.</p>

<p>We'll be looking to add more in the next few weeks. Tell us what you'd like on <a href="../support.html">the mailing list</a>.</p>

<h2>Annotations</h2>

<p>If you are using Java 5 then you can make use of the new DWR annotations thanks to Maik Schreiber. Combined with support for generic type reflection in milestone 1 (to get rid of the need for a &lt;signature&gt; element) you can use DWR without any need for dwr.xml. New annotations include @Create, @Convert, @RemoteMethod, @RemoteProperty.</p>

<p>For more detail see the <a href="../server/annotations.html">annotations documentation</a>.</p>

<h2>Jetty Continuations</h2>

<p>The ongoing work with Reverse Ajax is to ensure that no webservers get hurt as a result of the extra load. The first piece of the puzzle is from <a href="http://www.mortbay.com/MB/log/gregw/">Greg Wilkins</a> of <a href="http://jetty.mortbay.org/jetty/index.html">Jetty</a> fame. If Reverse Ajax is turned on in a Jetty servlet engine then DWR will automatically use Jetty's <a href="http://www.mortbay.com/MB/log/gregw/?permalink=Jetty6Continuations.html">Ajax Continuations</a> to save on server threads.</p>

<p>I'd like to expand the support to other servlet engines, but it looks like Jetty is quite a way ahead of the curve here. As I <a href="http://directwebremoting.org/blog/joe/2006/05/02/1146583328763.html">recently blogged</a>, we need a JSR for Continuations to make this easy.</p>

<h2>Other Changes</h2>

<p>A number of security mechanisms automatically send a login page back to the user if some security constraint times out. We've added an experimental feature to allow you to take special action if something replaces a DWR response with a login screen.</p>

<p>Commonly you might want to reload the current page to get to see the login screen properly. You can do that as follows:</p>

<pre>
DWREngine.setTextHtmlHandler(function() { document.location.reload(); });
</pre>

<p>Milestone 2 has also fixed lots of bugs. If you've reported anything wrong recently, please have a go and report back.</p>

<h2>Download</h2>
