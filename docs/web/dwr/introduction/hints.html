<h1>Answers to Common DWR Questions</h1>

<p>This is a list of common questions that developers encounter when working with DWR.</p>

<h2>How can I access Java Servlet objects (HttpServletRequest, etc.) in a method remoted by DWR?</h2>

<h2>How can I compress the JavaScript generated by DWR?</h2>

<h2>Why is DWR not logging exceptions generated from my server code?</h2>

<h2>How can I prevent DWR from serializing certain fields of a Java Bean?</h2>

<h2>How can I handle Exceptions within my DWR application?</h2>

<h2>How can I call a remote method that takes a Java Collection containing custom Java Beans?</h2>

<h2>How can I call a remote method that takes a Java Interface or Abstract Class as a parameter?</h2>

<h2>How can I pass extra data to DWR callback functions?</h2>

<h2>How can I handle scope issues in DWR callback functions?</h2>

<p>It's common to need to pass extra information to a callback method, but since all callback methods have only one parameter (the return code from the remote method) this can be tricky. There is a <a href="../browser/extra-data.html">whole page dedicated to helping you with this problem</a>.</p>
