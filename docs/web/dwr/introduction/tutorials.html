<h1>Tutorials and Examples</h1>

<p>There are 4 tutorials/examples of using DWR on this site. They are all aimed at understanding how DWR works rather than stretching the bounds of Ajax. These and many more examples are in the DWR.WAR file that you can deploy locally. See the <a href="../download.html">download page</a> for more details.</p>

<p>It is well worth making sure you understand the <a href="../introduction/getting-started.html">getting started</a> guide before you try re-creating these examples for yourself.</p>
