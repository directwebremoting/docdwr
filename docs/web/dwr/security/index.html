<h1>Security</h1>

<p>We take security very seriously with DWR and thought it was worth
explaining the steps we have gone through to avoid mistakes. We take
steps to ensure that methods on the server are only executed when they
should be, and that scripts sent to browsers are only sent to the
correct browsers. The latter deserves it's own section. See <a href="script-tag-protection.html">script tag protection</a>.</p>

<p>Firstly DWR takes the view that you should always know exactly what
is being remoted, and how. The principle is that DWR should only be
calling methods on your code with your explicit permission.</p>

<p>dwr.xml requires you to have a 'create' entry for each class that it
remotes. You can further refine this by specifying <a href="../server/configuration/dwrxml/creators/index.html">include and exclude
elements</a> which give you fine-grained control over exactly which
methods are called on your remoted beans.</p>

<p>In addition to this if you wish to allow DWR to convert your Java
Beans to and from Javascript you need to give it permission, and again
there is <a href="../server/configuration/dwrxml/converters/bean.html">fine grained
control</a> over which properties of the beans get converted.</p>

<p>An obvious point, but one that is worth making - don't run with the
test/debug console turned on in live. Turning the debug console on and
off is covered in the <a href="../server/configuration/servlet/test.html">section on
web.xml</a>.</p>

<h2>Security Support</h2>

<p>DWR has a mailing list designed specifically for discussing security
issues. It is designed so that we have a way to discuss DWR security
while minimizing the dangers associated with wide public dissemination.
The list is not about keeping problems secret forever, but it is about
responsible disclosure.</p>

<p>Further information about DWR mailing list and the security list in
particular is available on the <a href="../support/index.html">help
and support section</a>.</p>

<h2>Auditing - DWR's Big Benefit</h2>

<p>It is worth comparing DWR with servlets, JSPs or any many web
frameworks around.</p>

<p>If you wish to audit the DWR based functions it's fairly easy. Look
at dwr.xml and you can get a simple description of which methods are
exposed to the outside world. You can also see the full extent of what
is accessible using DWR.</p>

<p>However asking the same question of other systems is not as simple.
With servlets you need to examine your WEB-INF/web.xml file and then
look through the servlets looking for the calls to <code>request.getParameter(...)</code>,
with struts and other frameworks you need to examine the config file,
and then follow a similar process of looking over the source to see
what happens with the request information.</p>

<h2>Access Control</h2>

<p>DWR allows you to grant access using two J2EE based mechanisms.
Firstly you can define <a href="../server/configuration/servlet/multiconfig.html">access
to dwr based on J2EE roles</a>. Secondly within DWR you can <a href="../server/configuration/dwrxml/creators/index.html">define access to methods
on a role basis</a>.</p>

<h2>Other Measures</h2>

<p>DWR will not let you give create or convert access to any of its
internal classes. This is designed to make it impossible to
accidentally allow an attacker to manipulate the DWR core files to
elevate permissions.</p>

<h2>Risks</h2>

<p>What opportunities does an attacker have to exploit your system?
Using DWR an attacker can cause the server to create an instance of any
Java object that you specify in your dwr.xml, and (if you are using the
BeanConverter) any Java object that is in any of the parameters to the
methods to those classes. Any of the properties in those classes can
then be set with whatever data the attacker uses.</p>

<p>This is all a fairly obvious conclusion if you think about what DWR
is doing, but it could cause problems to the unwary. If you create a
FileBean with a <code>appendStringToFile()</code> method and export it
using DWR, then you are giving an attacker a simple method of filling
your file-system up.</p>

<p>It is important to think about the options you give attackers as a
result of using DWR.</p>

<p>Generally speaking this type of scenario may make DWR sound risky,
however generally speaking the same issues will exist with traditional
web architectures, it's just that they are less obvious and so less
likely to get fixed.</p>

<h2>But I'm Paranoid</h2>

<p>That's probably healthy; so what can you do to be extra double sure?</p>

<p>You can guard against failures in DWR access mechanisms by
separating the classes accessed by DWR into a separate package and have
them proxy to the real code. You can double check role based security
yourself if you wish. These options just double up on checks already
made by DWR.</p>

<p>Better than double checking might be to audit the DWR source to
ensure that the checks it is doing are correct. The code has been
checked over by several people already, but more eyes will always help.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>While we take security very seriously we do not claim that DWR is
totally secure, and we would be foolish to do so. The security of your
web site is your responsibility. DWR can help you by <a href="../downloads/index.html">providing source code</a> under an <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">open source
licence</a> that you can investigate for yourself, and we encourage you
to do this, as many already have.</p>
