<h1>Development Log</h1>

<p>The purpose of this page is to provide the community with the development team's status.  Our goal is to update this page at the very least on a monthly basis.  Please check back often if you are interested in the status of our next release.</p>

<h1>May 20th, 2009</h1>

<p>We are currently working on a plan to get the RC2 release out as soon as possible.  We currently have <a href="http://bugs.directwebremoting.org/bugs/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&mode=hide&sorter/order=DESC&sorter/field=priority&resolution=-1&pid=10000&fixfor=10090" target="new">25 outstanding issues for RC2</a>, but many of these issues either affect a very small percentage of the user base or are not critical.</p>

<b>Progress since April 20th, 2009</b>
<p>We have <a href="http://bugs.directwebremoting.org/bugs/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&requestId=10100">resolved approximately 20 issues since April 20th</a> and we have made several improvements to the documentation (new changes have not been published).</p>
