<h1>Configuring Reverse Ajax</h1>

<p>Reverse Ajax works in two  basic modes, Active and Passive. Active Reverse Ajax can be broken down into three modes:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#earlyClosing">Early Closing Mode</a> (Default)</li>
<li><a href="#fullStreaming">Full Streaming Mode</a> (Not available to IE users)</li>
<li><a href="#polling">Polling Mode</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This page describes these modes, when they make sense, and how to configure them. However, first you need to enable Reverse Ajax which is described in the next section - General Configuration.</p>
<h2>General Configuration</h2>
<p>To use Reverse Ajax in any of the modes listed below the following general configuration is necessary:</p>
<ol><li>Set the activeReverseAjaxEnabled init-param on the DWRServlet to true:
<pre>
&lt;servlet&gt;
  &lt;servlet-name&gt;dwr-invoker&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
  &lt;servlet-class&gt;org.directwebremoting.servlet.DwrServlet&lt;/servlet-class&gt;
  &lt;init-param&gt;
    &lt;param-name&gt;activeReverseAjaxEnabled&lt;/param-name&gt;
    &lt;param-value&gt;true&lt;/param-value&gt;
  &lt;/init-param&gt;
&lt;/servlet&gt;
</pre></li>
<li>Request Active Reverse Ajax from a web page:
<pre>
dwr.engine.setActiveReverseAjax(true);
</pre></li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="earlyClosing"></a>Early Closing Mode</h2>

<p>In Early Closing Mode, DWR holds connection open as in Full Streaming Mode, however it only holds the connection open for 60 seconds if there is no output to the browser. Once output occurs, DWR pauses for some configurable time (maxWaitAfterWrite) before closing the connection, forcing proxies to pass any messages on. To use Early Closing Mode in DWR 2.0.4 and onwards, no configuration is needed - this is the default.   The maxWaitAfterWrite parameter defaults to 500 (ms) and can be configured through an init-param on the DWRServlet: </p>

<pre>
&lt;init-param&gt;
  &lt;param-name&gt;maxWaitAfterWrite&lt;/param-name&gt;
  &lt;param-value&gt;1000&lt;/param-value&gt;
&lt;/init-param&gt;
</pre>

<p>In this case DWR will keep the connection open for an additional 1000 milliseconds after the first output in case there is additional output, before forcing a flush by closing the connection and requesting it to be re-opened.</p>

<p>The downside of Early Closing Mode is that for applications with a high rate of output, it can cause a large hit count. This can be countered by increasing the pause by setting maxWaitAfterWrite=1000 or similar.</p>

<p>In applications with a large number of connected browsers that are simultaneously sent a message they are likely to all try to reconnect at the same time. If you are affected by this type of problem, then you should consider investigating Full Streaming Mode.</p>

<p>A future version of DWR might attempt to automatically detect buggy proxies.</p>

<h2><a name="fullStreaming"></a>Full Streaming Mode (not available in IE)</h2>

<p>Full Streaming mode  has the fastest response characteristics because it closes connections only once every 60 seconds or so to check that the browser is still active. Due to limitations Internet Explorer users are unable to use Full Streaming mode.  All Internet Explorer users will be automatically pushed to Early Closing mode.</p>

<p>With a large number of connections held open, it is possible to thread starve an application server. Several web servers have a special mode to allow users to drop threads. DWR makes use of this functionality in Jetty from  version 2.0. DWR also attempts to protect all servers by dynamically reducing the connected time and increasing the disconnected time if the server load gets too high.</p>

<p>The problem with full streaming is that it requires HTTP chunked mode which sometimes fails with network proxies, mod_jk, and other network scanners. If you try full streaming and find that messages are only getting through every 60 seconds, this could be why. </p>

<p>To enable Full Streaming Mode in DWR, use the  maxWaitAfterWrite init-param with a -1 value:</p>

<pre>
&lt;init-param&gt;
  &lt;param-name&gt;maxWaitAfterWrite&lt;/param-name&gt;
  &lt;param-value&gt;-1&lt;/param-value&gt;
&lt;/init-param&gt;
</pre>

<p>DWR has special support for the Comet features in Jetty and Tomcat. The Jetty support is automatic, no special configuration is needed. For Tomcat you need to register a special version of the DwrServlet as follows:</p>

<pre>
&lt;servlet&gt;
  &lt;servlet-name&gt;dwr-invoker&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
  &lt;servlet-class&gt;org.directwebremoting.server.tomcat.DwrCometProcessor&lt;/servlet-class&gt;
  ...
&lt;/servlet&gt;
</pre>

<p>You also need to use Tomcat's nio connector:</p>
<pre>
&lt;Connector connectionTimeout="20000" port="8181"
   protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol" redirectPort="8443"/&gt;
</pre>

<h2><a name="polling"></a>Polling Mode</h2>

<p>If it is deemed unwise to hold connections open at all then DWR can use polling mode. In addition to the activeReverseAjaxEnabled=true init-param you should specify the PollingServerLoadMonitor as follows:</p>

<pre>
&lt;init-param&gt;
  &lt;param-name&gt;org.directwebremoting.extend.ServerLoadMonitor&lt;/param-name&gt;
  &lt;param-value&gt;org.directwebremoting.impl.PollingServerLoadMonitor&lt;/param-value&gt;
&lt;/init-param&gt;
</pre>

<p>In polling mode the default poll rate is every 5 seconds. This can be customized using the following:</p>

<pre>
&lt;init-param&gt;
  &lt;param-name&gt;disconnectedTime&lt;/param-name&gt;
  &lt;param-value&gt;60000&lt;/param-value&gt;
&lt;/init-param&gt;
</pre>

<p>The example above will poll only once every 60 seconds (60,000 milliseconds). For many applications a response time of 60 seconds will be enough, and will allow a web server to handle a very large number of clients.</p>

<p>There is a bug, fixed in DWR 2.0.2 where this parameter is badly mis-spelt. If you are using a version of DWR <b>before</b> 2.0.2 then you should use <code>timeToNextPoll</code> in place of <code>disconnectedTime</code>. The old spelling is deprecated rather than removed, however it will be removed in future releases.</p>

<h2>Passive Mode</h2>

<p>Passive Mode is the default if none of the options above are enabled. In passive mode, browsers do not make any extra connections to the web server. DWR queues data at the server in order to pass it on to clients. This transfer method is also known as the piggyback technique.</p>

<p>Passive Mode is the least responsive, however it does not place any extra load on the web-server.</p>
