<h1>Call Batching</h1>

<p>You can group several remote calls together using a batch. This saves on round trips to the server so there is much less latency involved.</p>

<p>A batch is started with <code>dwr.engine.beginBatch()</code> and ended with <code>dwr.engine.endBatch()</code>. When <code>endBatch()</code> is called, we are finished grouping a set of remote calls together, so DWR executes them in a single round trip to the server.</p>

<p>DWR takes care of ensuring that all the callbacks are called so you can turn batching on and off transparently. Just don't forget to call <code>endBatch()</code> or all your remote calls will be queued for ever.</p>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

<p>Clearly there are some side effects of batching a number of calls together. It would be impossible to be synchronous and batched at the same time for example.</p>

<p>All the call object options like hooks, timeouts and errorHandlers are done at a batch level rather than a call level. So if in a single batch you have 2 calls with different timeout values then all but the last will be ignored.</p>
