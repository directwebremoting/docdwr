<h1>Corporate Contributors License Agreement</h1>

<p>If you are submitting code where the copyright is held by a corporation, then you need a signed CCLA. DWR joined the Dojo Foundation in 2007, and since then, they have been handling legal matters for us, including managing CLAs. As a result of this rather than signing the Getahead CCLA, we now request Dojo Foundation CCLAs. Since both CCLAs were based on the Apache CCLA, there is very little change.</p>

</ul>

<p>The Dojo Foundation can accept fax, mail, or email a scans of the signed document. The text of the CCLA is included below, however, please use the PDF to print and sign.</p>

<p><strong>Processing note:</strong> If you send a scanned CLA to the Dojo Foundation, then please copy [joe&nbsp;at&nbsp;getahead&nbsp;dot&nbsp;org]. That way we know to which foundation project the CLA is primarily aimed at.</p>

The Dojo Foundation 
Corporate Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement")  
(derived from http://www.apache.org/licenses/, copyright The Apache Software Foundation) 
 
Thank you for your interest in The Dojo Foundation (the "Foundation").  In order to clarify the intellectual 
property license granted with Contributions of software from any person or entity, the Foundation must have a 
Contributor License Agreement on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the 
license terms below.  This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of the 
Foundation and its users; it does not change your right to use your own contributions for any other purpose.  
 
This version of the Agreement allows an entity (the "Corporation") to submit Contributions to the Foundation, 
to authorize Contributions submitted by its designated employees to the Foundation, and to grant copyright and 
patent licenses thereto. 
 
If you have not already done so, please complete this Agreement and send it by one of the following methods:  
 
Please read this document carefully before signing and keep the original for your records. 
 
Full Name:  Email:  
Mailing Address:  Telephone:  
  Facsimile:  
  Country:  
 
You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your past, present and future Contributions 
submitted to the Foundation. In return, the Foundation shall not use Your past, present and/or future 
Contributions in a way that is contrary to the public benefit or inconsistent with its nonprofit status and bylaws 
in effect at the time of the Contribution. Except for the license granted herein to the Foundation and to recipients 
of software distributed by the Foundation, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions. 
This Agreement supersedes any prior Contributor License Agreement You have executed in the past, and is 
retroactive in effect to the date of any prior Contributor License Agreement You have entered with the 
Foundation. 
 
1. Definitions. 
 
"You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is 
making this Agreement with the Foundation. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other 
entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single 
Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the 
direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent 
(50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity. 
 
"Contribution" shall mean the code, documentation or other original works of authorship expressly identified in 
Schedule B, as well as any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing 
work, that is intentionally submitted by You to the Foundation for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the 
products owned or managed by the Foundation (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" 
means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Foundation or its representatives, 
including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue 
tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Foundation for the purpose of discussing and 
improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in

writing by You as "Not a Contribution." 
 
2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the 
Foundation and to recipients of software distributed by the Foundation a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, 
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly 
display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works. 
 
3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the 
Foundation and to recipients of software distributed by the Foundation a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, 
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, 
offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims 
licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your 
Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) were submitted. If any entity institutes patent 
litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that 
your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent 
infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work 
shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. 
 
4. You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above license. You represent further that each 
employee of the Corporation designated on Schedule A below (or in a subsequent written modification to that 
Schedule) is authorized to submit Contributions on behalf of the Corporation. 
 
5. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see section 7 for submissions on 
behalf of others.).  
 
6. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide 
support.  You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all.  Unless required by applicable law or agreed 
to in writing, YOU PROVIDE YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS ON AN &#65533;&#65533;&#65533;AS-IS&#65533;&#65533;? BASIS, WITHOUT 
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND (EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED) INCLUDING, 
WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, 
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 
 
7. Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to the Foundation 
separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other 
restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are 
personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]". 
 
8. It is your responsibility to notify the Foundation promptly when any change is required to the list of 
designated employees authorized to submit Contributions on behalf of the Corporation, or to the Corporation's 
Contact with the Foundation.
