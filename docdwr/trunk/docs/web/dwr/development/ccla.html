<h1>Corporate Contributors License Agreement</h1>

<p>If you are submitting code where the copyright is held by a corporation, then you need a signed CCLA. DWR joined the Dojo Foundation in 2007, and since then, they have been handling legal matters for us, including managing CLAs. As a result of this rather than signing the Getahead CCLA, we now request Dojo Foundation CCLAs. Since both CCLAs were based on the Apache CCLA, there is very little change.</p>

</ul>

<p>The Dojo Foundation can accept fax, mail, or email a scans of the signed document.</p>

<p><strong>Processing note:</strong> If you send a scanned CLA to the Dojo Foundation, then please copy [joe&nbsp;at&nbsp;getahead&nbsp;dot&nbsp;org]. That way we know to which foundation project the CLA is primarily aimed at.</p>
