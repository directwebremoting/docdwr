<p>This page is divided into two sections.  The first section - titled <a href="#troubleshooting">"Troubleshooting"</a> provides advice to follow if you encounter problems configuring or using DWR.  The second section - title <a href="#commonProblems">"Common Problems and Fixes"</a> lists several common problems and their associated fixes.</p>
<h1><a name="troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting</h1>
<h2>Using the DWR
test page</h2>
<p>If you encounter problems using DWR your first step
  should be to check the DWR test page.  The test page displays all classes available to DWR and allows you to invoke  methods on those classes. If a method call works from the test page you have properly installed and configured DWR.</p>
<h5>Accessing
  the DWR test page</h5>
<ul>
  <li>The test page is located at
    http://yourwebapp:yourport/dwr/index.html.</li>
  <li>You must have the debug param set to true on the
    DWRServlet (in your web.xml) to access the test page.
    <pre class="book">&lt;servlet&gt;<br> &lt;servlet-name&gt;dwr-invoker&lt;/servlet-name&gt;<br> &lt;servlet-class&gt;org.directwebremoting.servlet.DwrServlet&lt;/servlet-class&gt;<br> &lt;init-param&gt;<br> &lt;param-name&gt;debug&lt;/param-name&gt;<br> &lt;param-value&gt;true&lt;/param-value&gt;<br> &lt;/init-param&gt; <br>&lt;/servlet&gt;
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>You should remove the debug param or set it to false
    in a production environment.</li>
</ul>
<h5>What to do
  when things work from the DWR test page, but do not work from a custom
page</h5>
This situation indicates that you
have a Javascript problem on your custom page.
<ul>
  <li><b>DWR is properly configured</b> - Don't
    waste time looking at the server (dwr.xml, web.xml, logs, etc.)</li>
  <li><b>Verify your JavaScript includes and paths</b> - The test page provides a list of  the necessary JavaScript
    files that you will be required to include on a custom page (engine.js,
    DWR generated interface files). Verify your custom page contains all of
    the necessary JavaScript includes. If the includes are present verify
    that they are properly pathed by attempting to open the files through
    the browser at the path you specified.</li>
  <li><b>Simplify, Simplify, Simplify</b> -
    Trim your script and simplify it as much as possible. If you are using
    any third party libraries remove them.</li>
  <li><b>Debug</b> - Look for JavaScript errors
    in the browser. If you are using IE try using Firefox as it generally
    gives you a much better description of any errors. You can open the
    Error Console in Firefox through the Tools menu. Another option is to use <a href="#firebug">Firebug</a> to debug through your JavaScript code.</li>
</ul>
<h5>What to do
when things don't work from the DWR test page or a custom page</h5>
This situation indicates that DWR is not properly configured.
<ul>
  <li>dwr.jar and commons-logging.jar - Verify that both jars are in your applications WEB-INF/lib directory.</li>
  <li><b>dwr.xml</b> - Verify your <a href="../server/configuration/dwrxml/index.html">dwr.xml</a> is in your WEB-INF
    directory and that it is valid and contains all of the necessary creators and
    converters.</li>
  <li><b>web.xml</b> - Verify your <a href="../server/servlet/index.html">web.xml</a> is in your WEB-INF
    directory and that it contains the necessary servlet definitions and
    mapping for DWR.</li>
  <li><b>Server logs</b> - If all else fails
    check the server's log files. DWR generally provides detailed logging
    and any errors will surely end up in your logs. </li>
  <li><b>Simplify, Simplify, Simplify</b> -
  Once again, simplify, simplify, simplify. Trim your logic and simplify it as much as possible. Verify that your Java code works outside of DWR.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Using the server logs</h5>
<p>The chances are if you encounter an error DWR will be
  logging the cause of the error in the server logs. Many times the
  errors in the log can quickly lead you to a fix for the problem you are
  experiencing. Here are a few examples:</p>
  <p>A failure to configure a converter for a class that DWR needs to
  serialize will result in the following error: </p>
<pre class="book">Jul 22, 2008 2:37:58 PM org.directwebremoting.util.CommonsLoggingOutput error<br>SEVERE: No converter found for 'dwr.book.model.User'<br> 
</pre>
A failure to add the commons-logging.jar into your application's
classpath will result in the following error:
<pre class="book">SEVERE: StandardWrapper.Throwable<br> java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/commons/logging/LogFactory<br> at org.directwebremoting.dwrp.PollHandler.&lt;clinit&gt;(PollHandler.java:382)<br> at java.lang.Class.forName0(Native Method)<br> 
</pre>
The logs are there for a reason -- use them. Many times reading the
logs will guide you to a quick solution.
<h5><a name="firebug"></a>Debugging with
Firebug or dwr.util.toDescriptiveString</h5>
<p>Firebug is an invaluable tool when you are having
  problems with your DWR application and need to inspect what you are
  sending to or receiving from DWR. Firebug is an add-on for Firefox that
  allows you to: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Set breakpoints and step through JavaScript code.</li>
  <li>Inspect requests and responses.</li>
</ul>
You can learn more about Firebug and download it on the <a href="http://getfirebug.com/" target="new">Firebug
site</a>. If you would like to use Firebug with a browser other
than Firefox take a look at <a href="http://getfirebug.com/lite.html" target="new">Firebug
Lite</a>.
<h5>dwr.util.toDescriptiveString</h5>
<p> If for some reason you cannot use Firebug the
  dwr.util.toDescriptiveString function will allow you to display the
  JavaScript objects you are sending to or receiving from DWR. This
  function is located in DWR's util.js and you must include this file in
  your HTML page in order to use it. The function takes three arguments: </p>
<ol>
  <li>The JavaScript object you would like to display.</li>
  <li>The depth you would like to traverse the object.</li>
  <li>An options object that can be used to customize the
    display.</li>
</ol>
You can read more about the dwr.util.toDescriptiveString method in the <a href="../browser/util/toDescriptiveString.html">DWR manual</a>.
<h5>Using an HTTP
Debugging Proxy</h5>
<p> HTTP debugging proxies are a nice tool to have in your
  arsenal. These tools allow you to inspect all HTTP traffic and even
  manipulate incoming/outgoing data. A few we recommend are: </p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.fiddlertool.com/fiddler/" target="new">Fiddler</a> - Fiddler is  free, has a
    lot of nice features and is stable.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.charlesproxy.com/" target="new">Charles</a> - Charles can be purchased
    for a small fee and has a lot of nice features. One of my favorite
    features is the bandwidth throttler that allows you to simulate
    different connection conditions.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Using a Java Debugger</h5>
<p> Many developers new to the web don't bother setting up
  a debugging environment. I feel this is a mistake. It is easy to do and
  you can learn a lot by stepping through code. Setting up a debugging
  environment is specific to your IDE and servlet container/application
  server and beyond the scope of our documentation. I recommend looking into the
  options that are available for the development environment you are
  working in. </p>
<h1><a name="commonProblems"></a>Common Problems and Fixes</h1>
<h2>TransformerFactoryConfigurationError</h2>
<p>This problem shows up as the following stack trace when starting a DWR enabled webapp:</p>
<pre>
root cause
javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactoryConfigurationError:
  Provider org.apache.xalan.processor.TransformerFactoryImpl not found
       javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory.newInstance(Unknown Source)
</pre>
<p>This doesn't really have much to do with DWR, it's caused by Tomcat not being setup properly. The quick answer is to <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/downloads.html">download Xalan</a> and place xalan.jar into <code>$TOMCAT-HOME/common/lib</code>. DWR 2.0 copes with this problem better than DWR 1.x, but the core problem is still that DWRs XML serialization support requires an XSLT parser.</p>
<p>If you have this problem with JDK 5 then it has been reported that the following VM parameter will kick Tomcat into action.</p>
<pre>
-Djavax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory=
   com.sun.org.apache.xalan.internal.xsltc.trax.TransformerFactoryImpl
</pre>
<h2>XML Parser Errors</h2>
<p>The most common error when getting started with DWR is an XML parser error. It has nothing to do with DWR, and is due to your installation of Tomcat having Xerces installed when it shouldn't or not installed when it should.</p>
<ul>
  <li>JDK 1.3 didn't come with an XML parser, so you will need xercesImpl.jar and xml-apis.jar for that case.</li>
  <li>JDK 1.4.0 and JDK 1.4.1 did come with an XML parser but it was buggy so you may need to override the default by putting xercesImpl.jar into the tomcat\common\endorsed directory.</li>
  <li>JDK 1.4.2 and JDK 5 come with a fully working XML parser and you shouldn't need one at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these issues, various version of Tomcat either came with XML parsers or had add-on packages that included them. It's important to check that you have the correct add-on packages for your JDK version.</p>
<h1>Classpath Issues With BEA Weblogic</h1>
<p>Weblogic 8.1 (and maybe other versions) can make it hard for DWR to find classes.</p>
<p>This can happen if dwr.jar is being used from an APP-INF directory (i.e. <code>APP_INF/lib</code>). Under these circumstances DWR will still appear to function, the debug pages will be visible for example, however it will have trouble finding your classes.</p>
<p>The solution is to place dwr.jar into your <code>WEB-INF/lib</code> directory.</p>
<h1>DWR and Multiple IEs on one machine</h1>
<p>Microsoft <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/cwilso/archive/2006/02/01/522281.aspx">discourage people</a> from using multiple versions of IE on a single machine, even though there are solutions like <a href="http://tredosoft.com/Multiple_IE?page=4">Tredosof Multiple IE</a>. The issue is that you never really have a full installation of the non-system browser. Cookie support is one area where multiple versions of IE breaks, which can cause problems with DWR's cross-domain security.</p>
<p>Probably the best solution is to use <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/virtualpc/default.mspx">Virtual PC</a>. This is Microsoft's <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/cwilso/archive/2006/02/01/522281.aspx">recommended solution</a>.</p>
<p>Alternatively you could disable DWRs cross domain security feature, by adding this parameter to your web.xml in the DWR servlet section:</p>
<pre>
&lt;init-param&gt;
  <span style="color:#080;">&lt;!-- fix for multiple IEs on one machine. Remove this before going live --&gt;</span>
  &lt;param-name&gt;crossDomainSessionSecurity&lt;/param-name&gt;
  &lt;param-value&gt;false&lt;/param-value&gt;
&lt;/init-param&gt;
</pre>
<h2>Annotations and Websphere</h2>
<p>Websphere is rather late to support Java5 and some versions of Websphere react strangely when Java5 code is found. DWR 2.x contains optional Java5 support. The vast majority of the JAR file was compiled with JDK 1.3 however the Annotations support was compiled with JDK 1.5. Normally a 1.4 JVM will throw an exception that DWR can catch using a normal try/catch mechanism, however for some reason the IBM 1.4 JVM seems to throw a magic uncatchable exception!. The following console message maybe found with Websphere / DWR 2.x.</p>
<pre>TRAS0014I: The following exception was logged
java.lang.LinkageError: LinkageError while defining class:
org.directwebremoting.annotations.AnnotationsConfigurator

Could not be defined due to:
org/directwebremoting/annotations/AnnotationsConfigurator
(Unsupported major.minor version 49.0)

This is often caused by having a class defined at multiple
locations within the classloader hierarchy. Other potential
causes include compiling against an older or newer version of
the class that has an incompatible method signature.
...
</pre>
<p>If this prevents DWR from working, there are 2 solutions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Download the source and remove org.directwebremoting.annotations.AnnotationsConfigurator.java before building</li>
  <li>Since dwr.jar is just a .zip file it is simple to open the file in a .zip editor and remove the offending class: org/directwebremoting/annotations/AnnotationsConfigurator.class</li>
</ul>
