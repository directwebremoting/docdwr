If you are having trouble getting DWR working  we ask that you please  follow the steps below to find a resolution - Thank you!<ol>
  <li><b>Step 1: Site resources</b> -  Please make sure you have read the following site resources, most questions asked could be easily resolved without contacting the list by viewing these resources (most importantly - <a href="common_problems.html">Solving Common Problems/Troubleshooting</a>):</li>
  <ol>
      <li>The <a href="../introduction/getting-started.html">Getting Started</a> guide explains how to configure and start to use DWR.</li>
      <li>For answers to some of the most common questions we receive see
the <a href="faqs.html">Answers to Common Questions</a> page.</li>
	  <li>On the <a href="common_problems.html"><b>Solving Common Problems/Troubleshooting</b></a> page we provide step-by-step instructions to follow if you encounter problems configuring or using DWR.  We also outline several of the more common issues encountered and how to resolve them.</li>
  </ol>
  <li><b>Step 2: Search the DWR-Users Mailing List</b>  -   Search <a href="http://dwr.2114559.n2.nabble.com/DWR-Users-f2114559.html">the mailing lists</a> to see if someone has had a similar problem.</li>
  <li><b>Step 3: Search JIRA</b> - Search our <a href="http://directwebremoting.org/bugs/secure/Dashboard.jspa">bug tracking system</a> for an issue that may be related to the issue you are experiencing.</li>
  <li><b>Step 4: Ask the DWR-Users Mailing List</b> - If a search of our mailing lists did not help, submit a question to the <a href="#users">DWR-Users Mailing List</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Step 5: <a href="http://directwebremoting.org/bugs/secure/Dashboard.jspa">File a bug report</a></b><b><span style="color:red;"> - NOTE THAT YOUR TICKET WILL BE CLOSED IMMEDIATELY IF YOU HAVE NOT PERFORMED THE STEPS ABOVE.</span></b></li>

<h3><a name="mailing_lists"></a>Mailing lists</h3>
<ol>
  <li><b><a href="#users"/>DWR-Users</a></b> - Designed for general questions related to DWR.  If you have a general question or are encountering a problem using DWR this is the mailing list you should use.</li>
  <li><b><a href="#dev"/>DWR-Dev</a></b> - Designed for DWR developers and development questions. This list SHOULD NOT BE USED for general questions or problems using DWR</li>
  <li><b><a href="#security"/>DWR-Security</a></b> - A restricted list designed to discuss security related issues specific to DWR's code-base while minimizing the dangers associated with wide public dissemination.</li>
</ol>

<p>The DWR mailing lists are hosted by java.net with the exception of the <a href="#security"/>security list</a> which is hosted by Google Groups. You can join
Java.net by <a href="https://java.net/people/new" target="_blank">registering
here</a>, and then you can <a href="http://java.net/projects/dwr/lists" target="_blank">subscribe</a>.
However, you should not need to subscribe (although it is recommended) to take part - web interfaces
are available.  If you do not subscribe keep in mind that the lists are moderated for non-subscribers.  This means that before your message is distributed to the list it will be delayed until we have accepted it.</p>

<p>Please <a href="http://java.net/projects/help/pages/MailingLists#Using_Mailing_Lists" target="_blank">see java.net's help page</a> if you need assistance subscribing/unsubscribing to or sending an email to one of our lists.</p>

<h2><a name="users"></a>DWR-Users Mailing List</h2>

<p>The users mailing list is where the vast majority of discussions
 about DWR take place. If you have a general question or are encountering a problem using DWR this is the mailing list you should use.</p>

<b>Before sending a message to the list please make sure you:<br> <ol><li><a href="#steps">Followed the steps at the top of this page</a>.</li><li>Include the version of DWR you are using.</li><li> Include   information you have gathered while <a href="common_problems.html">troubleshooting</a> your problem.</li></ol></b><p>You can send email to the list directly using: [users at

<h2><a name="security">DWR-Security</a></h2>

<p>The idea behind the dwr-security mailing list is that we should have a way to discuss DWR security while minimizing the dangers associated with wide public dissemination. The list is not about keeping problems secret forever, but it is about responsible disclosure.</p>

<p>Just to be clear: dwr-security is NOT another option for getting support when something doesn't work.</p>

<p><strong>Membership rules</strong>: Since dwr-security is about responsible disclosure, we would like to know who the members are. Almost everyone wants to subscribe from a gmail or similar web-based address. That's OK, but we want to link web addresses to some type of corporate address OR have some other way of positively identifying you.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you are subscribing using a corporate email address, please make sure we know your full name and job title in the request.</li>
<li>If you are subscribing using a web-based email address, please apply in the same way but also send an email from your corporate address to [david at butterdev dot com] at the same time.</li>
<li>If you don't have a corporate email address, please find some other way to identify yourself to us.</li>
</ul>

<p>Applications to join can be <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/dwr-security">made using Google Groups</a>. <strong>BUT</strong> the majority of applications to dwr-security are rejected because the applicant has not read the section above properly. Understanding it is not optional.</p>

<p>Anyone can post to the list using the address: [dwr-security at googlegroups.com]. You don't need to be a member to post to the list, but it does increase your spam score, so if you don't receive a fast answer you should try alerting [users at dwr.dev.java.net] to the fact that there is moderation that needs to happen.</p>
