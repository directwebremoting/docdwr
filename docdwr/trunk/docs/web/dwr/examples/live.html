<h1>Who is using DWR?</h1>

<p>Many projects are using DWR on intranet sites, this generally means they're hard to find out about, and impossible to link to an check. It is possible to discover a small fraction of the commercial users by looking at the IP addresses that read the DWR DTD files.</p>

<p>From this we can tell that DWR has a large users which probably include Bank of America, Mastercard, Citigroup, Deutschebank, Permanent General, Dow Jones, RSA Security, Cap Gemini, The International Olympic Committee, IBM in the US, China and India, Caterpillar, 20th Century Fox, UCG, Lufthansa, Associated Press, Monsanto, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories and the states of New York and Georgia. Many of these appear to be using DWR from multiple development sites.</p>

<p>It is estimated that something like 40,000 developers worldwide are actively using DWR, or at least editing DWR config files with an official DTD. Since many users will be configuring DWR using annotations, or be behind a firewall, this may be an under-estimate. The conversion between DTD hits and developers is estimated based on the hits that the DWR developers themselves make to the DTD.</p>

<p>The following is a small selection of some sites that are publicly available.</p>

<h2>American Airlines</h2>
<a href="http://www.aa.com/">American Airlines</a> are using DWR right off their home page. Doing a flight search using the new "Price and Schedule" will go into 'DWR-mode':
<img src="../images/aa-feature.png" alt="Pick the new 'Price and Schedule' feature"/>
<p>The results page uses <a href="../index.html">DWR</a> to fetch extra details on a flight.</p>
<p>For more information see <a href="http://directwebremoting.org/blog/joe/2007/06/06/american_airlines_using_dwr.html">Joe's blog entry</a>.</p>

<h2>Walmart</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.walmart.com">Walmart</a> are using <a href="../dwr/index.html">DWR</a> for their online store. It's not a total re-design around DWR, but one of the cool things about DWR has always been how well it has integrated with what you've already got.</p>
<p>Lots of the pages <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=5871510">like this clothing page</a> have links that use DWR. Keeping track of pages on the Walmart site is tricky because pages die when the products are no longer sold. So if you get the Walmart home-page it's because we need to update the linked product id.</p>
<p style="clear:both">For more information see <a href="http://directwebremoting.org/blog/joe/2006/12/04/walmart_using_dwr.html">this entry in Joe's blog</a>.</p>

<h2>New York City Maps</h2>
<p>The City of New York is using DWR for its <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/citymap">city map</a>.</p>
<a href="../images/newyork-screen.png"><img src="../images/newyork-thumb.png"/ align="left" style="margin:0 20px 10px 0" border="0"></a>
<p>Click for a larger version, or <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/citymap">head on over to the site</a>.</p>
<p>The site is designed for IE6 and there are some scrolling issues with Firefox, but I'm sure they will fix those soon.</p>
<p>Like Google Maps, there are the usual scroll/zoom features, but the New York mapping tool adds overlays for looking up zip codes and for landmarks, and allows you to pick the details that are shown or hidden.</p>
