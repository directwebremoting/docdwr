<h1>Signatures in dwr.xml</h1>

<p>The signatures section is used to enable resolution of the types stored in Collections when specific generic types are not being used. For example in the following code DWR has no way to know what it should cast the incoming data to:</p>

<pre>
public class Check
{
  public List&lt;?&gt; setLotteryResults(List&lt;?&gt; whatDoIContain)
  {
      ...
  }
}
</pre>

<p>However, if the method signature was changed to:</p>

<pre>
public class Check
{
  public List&lt;Integer&gt; setLotteryResults(List&lt;Integer&gt; whatDoIContain)
  {
      ...
  }
}
</pre>

<p>DWR uses the generic type to cast the incoming data.  This is possible because DWR 3.x requires Java 1.5 or greater - because of this DWR signatures are largely obsolete.</p>
