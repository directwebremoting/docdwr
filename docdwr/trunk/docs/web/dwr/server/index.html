<h1>Server Side Documentation</h1>

<h2>Configuring DWR</h2>

<p>There are several ways to configure DWR:</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="dwrxml/index.html">dwr.xml</a> is the default</li>
  <li>or if you don't like XML, you can <a href="annotations.html">configure
DWR using annotations</a></li>
  <li>The <a href="integration/spring.html">Spring integration</a> is
useful if you are using Spring anyway</li>
  <li>And likewise with <a href="integration/guice.html">Guice
integration</a></li>
  <li>In the NON-CLA jar of additions to DWR there is a <a href="configuration/fluent.html">Fluent configuration system</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Other Parts of the Server</h2>

<p>We have documented the DWR <a href="configuration/servlet/index.html">additions
to web.xml</a>, and enabled access to parts of the <a href="javaapi.html">Java Servlet API</a>, to understand <a href="environment.html">supported environments</a> or see the various
projects that <a href="integration/index.html">DWR integrates with</a>.</p>

<h2>Generated Documentation</h2>

<p>In addition to the documentation in this handbook there is also a
few sources of generated documentation:</p>

<h3>JavaDoc</h3>

<p>The <a href="/docdwr/docs/web/dwr-javadoc/">JavaDoc for the latest
development version of DWR</a> is probably the best place to look for
detailed documentation right now. The class level javadoc is fairly
good - although there isn't enough package documentation yet.</p>

<h3>DTD-Doc</h3>

<p>As of the latest development version, we are also generating <a href="/docdwr/dwr-dtddoc/">DTD-Doc pages</a>. Since the DTD files are
versioned, we don't separately publish from old source trees. All you
need should be in the DTD versions supported by the latest version of
DWR.</p>
