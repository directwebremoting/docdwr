<h1>Generated Documentation</h1>

<p>In addition to the documentation in this handbook there is also a few sources of generated documentation:</p>

<h2>JavaDoc</h2>

<p>The <a href="/M:/Users/joe/Projects/directwebremoting/docdwr/docs/web/dwr-javadoc/">JavaDoc for the latest development version of DWR</a> is probably the best place to look for detailed documentation right now. The class level javadoc is fairly good - although there isn't enough package documentation yet.</p>

<h2>DTD-Doc</h2>

<p>As of the latest development version, we are also generating <a href="/M:/Users/joe/Projects/directwebremoting/docdwr/dwr-dtddoc/">DTD-Doc pages</a>. Since the DTD files are versioned, we don't separately publish from old source trees. All you need should be in the DTD versions supported by the latest version of DWR.</p>
