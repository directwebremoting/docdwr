<h1>Non-Web Threads and Reverse Ajax</h1>

<p>It's easy to use DWR and Reverse Ajax from a thread outside of DWR. You can't use WebContext though because it is only available  to threads under the control of DWR.</p>

<p>You have three options:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use the <a href="hints-and-tips.html#browserAPI">Browser API</a>. <p>It is important to note that a few Browser methods required a WebContext meaning the requests come from a DWR thread.  Currently the methods that require this are - withCurrentPageFiltered, withCurrentPage, and getTargetSessions.  All other methods can be called safely from non-DWR threads.</p></li>
  <li>Obtain the ScriptSessionManager, which will provide  access to the ScriptSessions:
 
<pre>
Container container = ServerContextFactory.get().getContainer();
ScriptSessionManager manager = container.getBean(ScriptSessionManager.class);
</pre></li>
  <li>Use <a href="http://directwebremoting.org/dwr/javadoc/org/directwebremoting/ServerContext.html">ServerContext</a> (most of the methods here have been deprecated, although they are still available).</li>
</ol>

<h2>PageNormalizers</h2>

<p>It is possible that you may get a message like this when you first start to use reverse ajax:</p>

<pre>
Can't find ServletContext to check for &lt;welcome-file-list&gt; in web.xml. Assuming defaults.
- To prevent this message from happening, either call the PageNormalizer from a DWR Thread
- Or seed the PageNormalizer with a ServletContext before access from outside a DWR thread
</pre>

<p>Reverse Ajax has a problem - calls to getScriptSessionsForPage() need to  know that index.html resolves to the same thing as index.htm (for example), but the only way they can do this is to know the "welcome-files" setting in web.xml. This is all the responsibility of the PageNormalizer.</p>

<p>That's OK - it can parse web.xml to read the information, but to do that we need to know the ServletContext, and that isn't available to you if you are starting from nothing.</p>

<p>In essence, how does a PageNormalizer that does not know anything about the web, get in contact with a ServletContext.</p>

<p>There are 2 options:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Access PageNormalizer from a DWR thread before you access it from outside of DWR. That way it can use WebContext.get().getServletContext() and cache the result for later use</li>

<li>2. Set the ServletContext manually with DefaultPageNormalizer.getServletContext()</li>
</ul>

<p>Take a look at the source to <a href="http://fisheye5.cenqua.com/browse/dwr/demo/org/getahead/dwrdemo/gidemo/Publisher.java?r=1.9">Publisher.java</a> - it has this same problem. From the constructor:</p>

<pre>
WebContext webContext = WebContextFactory.get();
ServletContext servletContext = webContext.getServletContext();

serverContext = ServerContextFactory.get(servletContext);

// A bit nasty: the call to serverContext.getScriptSessionsByPage()
// below could fail because the system might need to read web.xml which
// means it needs a ServletContext, which is only available using
// WebContext, which in turn requires a DWR thread. We can cache the
// results simply by calling this in a DWR thread, as we are now.
webContext.getScriptSessionsByPage("");
</pre>
