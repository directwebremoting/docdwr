<h2>Getting Started with DWR</h2>

<p>There are 2 ways to get started with DWR, the easy way is to <a href="../download.html">download</a> the WAR file and have a look around, however this does not help you see how easily DWR integrates with your current web application, so the following 5 simple steps are recommended:</p>

<h4>1. Install the DWR JAR file</h4>
<p><a href="../download.html">Download</a> the dwr.jar file. Place it in the <code>WEB-INF/lib</code> directory of your webapp. You'll probably have a set of jar files in there already.</p>

<h4>2. Install the Commons Logging JAR file</h4>
<p>DWR has one dependency on  <a href="http://commons.apache.org/logging/" target="new">Commons Logging</a>. <a href="http://commons.apache.org/logging/" target="new">Download</a> the commons-logging.jar and place it in the <code>WEB-INF/lib</code> directory of your webapp.</p>

<h4>3. Add the DWR servlet definition and mapping to your application's web.xml</h4>
<p>The following lines need to be added to <code>WEB-INF/web.xml</code>. The <code>&lt;servlet&gt;</code> section needs to go with the other <code>&lt;servlet&gt;</code> sections, and likewise with the <code>&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;</code> section.</p>

<pre>
&lt;servlet&gt;
  &lt;servlet-name&gt;dwr-invoker&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
  &lt;display-name&gt;DWR Servlet&lt;/display-name&gt;
  &lt;servlet-class&gt;org.directwebremoting.servlet.DwrServlet&lt;/servlet-class&gt;
  &lt;init-param&gt;
     &lt;param-name&gt;debug&lt;/param-name&gt;
     &lt;param-value&gt;true&lt;/param-value&gt;
  &lt;/init-param&gt;
&lt;/servlet&gt;

&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
  &lt;servlet-name&gt;dwr-invoker&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
  &lt;url-pattern&gt;/dwr/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;
</pre>

<h4>4. Create the DWR configuration file (dwr.xml)</h4>
<p>Create a new file in the WEB-INF (alongside web.xml) directory named dwr.xml.</p>
<p>A simple way to start is with something like this:</p>

<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE dwr PUBLIC
    "-//GetAhead Limited//DTD Direct Web Remoting 3.0//EN"
    "<a href="../dwr30.dtd">http://getahead.org/dwr/dwr30.dtd</a>"&gt;

&lt;dwr&gt;
  &lt;allow&gt;
    &lt;create creator="new" javascript="JDate"&gt;
      &lt;param name="class" value="java.util.Date"/&gt;
    &lt;/create&gt;
    &lt;create creator="new" javascript="Demo"&gt;
      &lt;param name="class" value="your.java.Bean"/&gt;
    &lt;/create&gt;
  &lt;/allow&gt;
&lt;/dwr&gt;
</pre>

<p>The DWR config file defines what classes DWR can create and remote for use by Javascript. In the example above we are defining 2 classes that are remoted and giving the classes names in Javascript.</p>

<p>The <a href="../server/dwrxml/creators/new.html">new creator</a> that we used above uses the public no-args constructor that all JavaBeans must have. It is also worth remembering that DWR has one restriction:</p>

<ul>

<li>Avoid reserved JavaScript words; Methods named after reserved words are automatically excluded. Most JavaScript reserved words are also Java reserved words, so you won't be having a method called "try()" anyway. However the most common gotcha is "delete()", which has special meaning in JavaScript but not Java.</li>

</ul>

<p><a href="../server/dwrxml/index.html">Visit the dwr.xml documentation</a> for a detailed description of the dwr.xml file, creators and converters.</p>

<h4>5. Take DWR for a test drive!</h4>
<p>Go to the following URL:</p>
<code>http://localhost:8080/<i>[YOUR-WEBAPP]</i>/dwr/</code>

<p>You should see a page showing you the classes that you've selected in step 4. Having followed a link you should see an index of all the methods ready for calling. These pages are dynamically generated examples of what you can do using DWR.</p>

<p>Kick the tyres and have a look around.</p>

<h3>How to make use of this from your web application</h3>

<p>We have a whole section on <a href="scripting-dwr.html">writing Javascript with DWR</a>, and there are a number of examples in the sidebar that demonstrate how to dynamically alter the text in web pages, update lists, manipulate forms and do live table editing. Each has a description of how it works.</p>

<p>Another way to get started is to look at the source from the pages that you just viewed:</p>

<ul>

<li>Go to http://localhost:8080/<i>[YOUR-WEBAPP]</i>/dwr/ and click on you class</li>
<li>View source and find the line that executes the method that you are interested in.</li>
<li>Paste the text into an HTML or JSP page in your web-app.</li>
<li>Include links to the javascript files that make the magic happen:</li>

</ul>

<pre>
&lt;script src='/<i>[YOUR-WEBAPP]</i>/dwr/interface/<i>[YOUR-SCRIPT]</i>.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src='/<i>[YOUR-WEBAPP]</i>/dwr/engine.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>You can omit the <code>/<i>[YOUR-WEBAPP]</i>/</code> section and use relative paths in your web pages if you wish.</p>

<p>Next Step: Learn about <a href="scripting-dwr.html">writing Javascript that interacts with DWR</a>.</p>

<h3>What if it doesn't work?</h3>

<p>We have a <a href="../other/fixes.html">page containing troubleshooting advice and common problems and their fixes</a>. This is the first place to look.</p>

<p>If you are still having problems please <a href="../support.html">join the mailing list</a> and ask there.</p>
