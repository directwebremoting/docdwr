<h4>Java.net: <a href="http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2005/08/25/dwr.html">DWR Chat Application Demo</a></h4>

<p>About DWR from it's principle author - <a href="http://directwebremoting.org/blog/joe">Joe Walker</a></p>

<p class="quote">Excerpt: <small>This article demonstrates the use of DWR to create a multi-user web-based chat site. It demonstrates how simple it is to integrate JavaScript in the web browser with Java on the server. The aim is to have a fully functional system in about 100 lines of code for both the client and the server...</small></p>

<p>This introduction has been <a href="http://www.servicerules.com.ar/articles.do?pageId=devel_ajax_apps">translated into Spanish by Mariano Ayesa</a> and <a href="http://www.javastaff.com/article.php?story=20051118193614328">translated  into Italian by Federico Paparoni</a>.</p>

<p>Katherine Martin updated this article with the release of DWR 2.0 to include <a href="http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2007/03/22/developing-applications-using-reverse-ajax.html">chat using reverse ajax</a>.</p>

<p class="quote">With release 2.0, DWR continues on the same theme, removing from the developers shoulders the pesky problem of "pushing" information. It introduces the term reverse Ajax to describe this asynchronous transfer of messages from server to browser or browsers.</p>

<h4>IBM DeveloperWorks: <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-ajax3/">Ajax with Direct Web Remoting</a></h4>

<p>Data serialization doesn't get any easier than this! by <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-ajax3/#author">Phil McCarthy</a></p>

<p class="quote">Excerpt: <small>Philip McCarthy shows you how to use Direct Web Remoting (DWR) to expose JavaBeans methods directly to your JavaScript code and automate the heavy-lifting of Ajax... While DWR is not the only Ajax-RPC toolkit available for the Java platform, it is one of the most mature, and it offers a great deal of useful functionality.</small></p>

<p>Introduction to Ajax and DWR by <a href="http://tearesolutions.com/">David Teare</a></p>

<p class="quote">Excerpt: <small>For Java Developers there are a number of different frameworks/libraries that hide most of the complexity of developing AJAX-enabled Web applications. For this purposes of this article I'll be using one of those libraries called DWR or Direct Web Remoting. I chose DWR because I haven't found another framework/library that's easier to use or as flexible...</small></p>

<p>The <a href="http://java.sys-con.com/read/286892.htm
">print version of this page</a> is a lot more readable and doesn't contain any embedded videos or pop over dialogs.</p>
