<h2>Getting Started with DWR</h2>

<p>There are 2 ways to get started with DWR, the easy way is to <a href="../download.html">download</a> the WAR file and have a look around, however this does not help you see how easily DWR integrates with your current web application, so the following 3 simple steps are recommended:</p>

<h4>1. Install the DWR JAR file</h4>
<p><a href="../download.html">Download</a> the dwr.jar file. Place it in the <code>WEB-INF/lib</code> directory of your webapp. You'll probably have a set of jar files in there already. From version 2.0, DWR also requires <a href="http://commons.apache.org/logging/">commons-logging</a>.</p>

<h4>2. Edit the config files</h4>
<p>The following lines need to be added to <code>WEB-INF/web.xml</code>. The <code>&lt;servlet&gt;</code> section needs to go with the other <code>&lt;servlet&gt;</code> sections, and likewise with the <code>&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;</code> section.</p>

<pre>
&lt;servlet&gt;
  &lt;servlet-name&gt;dwr-invoker&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
  &lt;display-name&gt;DWR Servlet&lt;/display-name&gt;
  &lt;servlet-class&gt;org.directwebremoting.servlet.DwrServlet&lt;/servlet-class&gt;
  &lt;init-param&gt;
     &lt;param-name&gt;debug&lt;/param-name&gt;
     &lt;param-value&gt;true&lt;/param-value&gt;
  &lt;/init-param&gt;
&lt;/servlet&gt;

&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
  &lt;servlet-name&gt;dwr-invoker&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
  &lt;url-pattern&gt;/dwr/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;
</pre>

<p>If you are using DWR 1.x then the servlet-class line should contain the following: <code>uk.ltd.getahead.dwr.DWRServlet</code>. The 1.x version will still work with 2.x, but the new one is preferred.</p>

<p>Then create a dwr.xml file that lives in WEB-INF alongside web.xml. A simple way to start is with something like this:</p>

<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE dwr PUBLIC
    "-//GetAhead Limited//DTD Direct Web Remoting 2.0//EN"
    "<a href="../dwr20.dtd">http://getahead.org/dwr/dwr20.dtd</a>"&gt;

&lt;dwr&gt;
  &lt;allow&gt;
    &lt;create creator="new" javascript="JDate"&gt;
      &lt;param name="class" value="java.util.Date"/&gt;
    &lt;/create&gt;
    &lt;create creator="new" javascript="Demo"&gt;
      &lt;param name="class" value="your.java.Bean"/&gt;
    &lt;/create&gt;
  &lt;/allow&gt;
&lt;/dwr&gt;
</pre>

<p>Obviously, if you are using version 1.x the opening line will have 1.0 in place of 2.0 and 10 in place of 20.</p>

<p>The DWR config file defines what classes DWR can create and remote for use by Javascript. In the example above we are defining 2 classes that are remoted and giving the classes names in Javascript.</p>

<p>The <code>new</code> creator that we used above uses the public no-args constructor that all JavaBeans must have. It is also worth remembering that DWR has a few restrictions:</p>

<ul>

<li>Avoid reserved JavaScript words; Methods named after reserved words are automatically excluded. Most JavaScript reserved words are also Java reserved words, so you won't be having a method called "try()" anyway. However the most common gotcha is "delete()", which has special meaning from JavaScript but not Java.</li>

<li>Overloaded methods can be involved in a bit of a lottery as to which gets called, so avoid overloaded methods.</li>

</ul>

<h4>3. Go to the following URL</h4>

<code>http://localhost:8080/<i>[YOUR-WEBAPP]</i>/dwr/</code>

<p>You should see a page showing you the classes that you've selected in step 2. Having followed a link you should see an index of all the methods all ready for calling. These pages are dynamically generated examples of what you can do using DWR.</p>

<p>Kick the tyres and have a look around.</p>

<h3>How to make use of this from your web application</h3>

<p>We have a whole section on <a href="scripting-dwr.html">writing Javascript with DWR</a>, and there are a number of examples in the sidebar that demonstrate how to dynamically alter the text in web pages, update lists, manipulate forms and do live table editing. Each has a description of how it works.</p>

<p>Another way to get started is to look at the source from the pages that you just viewed:</p>

<ul>

<li>Go to http://localhost:8080/<i>[YOUR-WEBAPP]</i>/dwr/ and click on you class</li>
<li>View source and find the line that executes the method that you are interested in.</li>
<li>Paste the text into an HTML or JSP page in your web-app.</li>
<li>Include links to the javascript files that make the magic happen:</li>

</ul>

<pre>
&lt;script src='/<i>[YOUR-WEBAPP]</i>/dwr/interface/<i>[YOUR-SCRIPT]</i>.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src='/<i>[YOUR-WEBAPP]</i>/dwr/engine.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>You can omit the <code>/<i>[YOUR-WEBAPP]</i>/</code> section and use relative paths in your web pages if you wish.</p>

<h3>What if it doesn't work?</h3>

<p>We have a <a href="../other/fixes.html">log of common problems and their fixes</a>. This is the first place to look.</p>
