<h1>Development Log</h1>

<p>The purpose of this page is to provide the community with the development team's status.  If you find that this page has not been updated in awhile that does not mean development has stopped - we may just be very busy.  There are several others ways to check for activity - <a href="http://directwebremoting.org/bugs/secure/Dashboard.jspa" target="new">JIRA</a>, <a href="http://ci.directwebremoting.org/bamboo/" target="new">Bamboo</a>, or our <a href="http://dwr.2114559.n2.nabble.com/DWR-Users-f2114559.html" target="new">mailing list</a> to see recent activity on the project.</p>

<h1>October 7, 2010</h1>
<p>We are very close to an RC2 release that we are planning for later this month.  We are hoping to follow this release up with an official 3.0 release sometime early 2011.  The official 3.0 release will be missing some of the reverse AJAX issues we have been working.  They will be in version 3.0.1.

<h1>December 18th, 2009</h1>
<p>
Over the last few months we have been very busy on admistrative tasks.  We have moved our hosted sites over to a Dojo Foundation VPS.  This has allowed us a lot more control.  We have configured bamboo on the VPS and we now have <a href="http://ci.directwebremoting.org/bamboo/">continuous integration builds up and running</a>.  We have also set-up a Maven repository and are currently working on getting our builds automatically synched with Maven central (thanks to Henric Larsson).  We have completed several issues for a 2.0.6 release which will be out shortly.  We have also made progress on deadlock and concurrency issues (thanks to Tim Peierls).  I am currently working on integrating some of Tim's recommendations into our codebase.</p>

<h1>July 9th, 2009</h1>
<p>
We are still slowly working toward an RC2 release.  We currently have one unresolved issue scheduled for RC2 which is related to a deadlock in some of the sleeper code.    We have started working on release notes and updated documentation for the RC2 release.  Since the last update we have <a href="http://bugs.directwebremoting.org/bugs/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&requestId=10110" target="new"">resolved approximately 20 issues</a>.  </p>

<h1>May 20th, 2009</h1>

<p>We are currently working on a plan to get the RC2 release out as soon as possible.  We currently have <a href="http://bugs.directwebremoting.org/bugs/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&mode=hide&sorter/order=DESC&sorter/field=priority&resolution=-1&pid=10000&fixfor=10090" target="new">25 outstanding issues for RC2</a>, but many of these issues either affect a very small percentage of the user base or are not critical.</p>

<b>Progress since April 20th, 2009</b>
<p>We have <a href="http://bugs.directwebremoting.org/bugs/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&requestId=10100">resolved approximately 20 issues since April 20th</a> and we have made several improvements to the documentation (new changes have not been published).</p>
