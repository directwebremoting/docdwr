<h1>Development Log</h1>

<p>The purpose of this page is to provide the community with the development team's status.  Our goal is to update this page once a month (or every few months).  Please check back often if you are interested in the status of our next release.</p>

<h1>July 9th, 2009</h1>
<p>
We are still slowly working toward an RC2 release.  We currently have one unresolved issue scheduled for RC2 which is related to a deadlock in some of the sleeper code.    We have started working on release notes and updated documentation for the RC2 release.  Since the last update we have <a href="http://bugs.directwebremoting.org/bugs/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&requestId=10110" target="new"">resolved approximately 20 issues</a>.  </p>

<h1>May 20th, 2009</h1>

<p>We are currently working on a plan to get the RC2 release out as soon as possible.  We currently have <a href="http://bugs.directwebremoting.org/bugs/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&mode=hide&sorter/order=DESC&sorter/field=priority&resolution=-1&pid=10000&fixfor=10090" target="new">25 outstanding issues for RC2</a>, but many of these issues either affect a very small percentage of the user base or are not critical.</p>

<b>Progress since April 20th, 2009</b>
<p>We have <a href="http://bugs.directwebremoting.org/bugs/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&requestId=10100">resolved approximately 20 issues since April 20th</a> and we have made several improvements to the documentation (new changes have not been published).</p>
