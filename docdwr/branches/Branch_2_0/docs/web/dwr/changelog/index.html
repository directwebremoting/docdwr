<h1>Development Log</h1>

<p>The purpose of this page is to provide the community with the development team's status.  Our goal is to update this page at the very least on a monthly basis.  Please check back often if you are interested in the status of our next release.</p>

<h1>May 20th, 2009</h1>

<p>We are currently working on a plan to get the RC2 release out as soon as possible.  We currently have 25 outstanding issues for RC2, but many of these issues either affect a very small percentage of the user base or are not critical.</p>

<b>Progress since last update</b>
<p>We have resolved 13 issues since April 20th and we have made several improvements to the documentation (new changes have not been published).</p>
