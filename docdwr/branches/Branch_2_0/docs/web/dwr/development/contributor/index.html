<h1>Contributors</h1>

<p>DWR is maintained by a group of people, lead by <a href="http://directwebremoting.org/blog/joe/">Joe Walker</a>. We try to keep clear maintainers for each part of DWR, but we also seek to prevent code ownership from becoming a barrier to refactoring.</p>

<p>The current maintainers are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lead: David Marginian</li>
<li>DWR Util: Mike Wilson</li>
<li>Spring: <a href="http://internna.blogspot.com/">Jose Noheda</a>, <a href="http://www.kuripai.com/">Brendan Grainger</a> and <a href="http://bram.jteam.nl/">Bram Smeets</a> (<a href="http://www.springsource.com/">Spring Source</a>)</li>
<li>Maven: Henric Larson</li>
<li>Guice: <a href="http://tembrel.blogspot.com/">Tim Peierls</a></li>
<li>Webwork: <a href="http://themindstorms.blogspot.com/">Alex Proprescu</a> (<a href="http://www.infow.com/">InfoQ</a>)</li>
<li>Struts v1: Ariel O. Falduto</li>
<li>Scriptaculous: Mitch Gorman</li>
<li>Rico: Mitch Gorman</li>
<li>Faces: Pierpaolo Follia</li>
<li>Beehive: Kevin Conaway</li>
</ul>

<p>There are some <a href="contract.html">'rules' for contributors</a>. They're not onerous, but are designed to help us develop in harmony.</p>

<h1>Getting Involved</h1>

<p>We are always on the lookout for more help. If you want to get involved, you should do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Join the <a href="../../support.html">mailing list</a>. It's probably best to join dwr-dev and dwr-users</li>
<li>Get involved by helping users, and seeing how we do things.</li>
<li>Play with DWR and see if there is anything that you think is broken or missing.</li>
<li>Get an account in our <a href="http://bugs.directwebremoting.org/bugs/">bug tracking system</a>, and either find an issue to work on, or create an issue.</li>
<li>Post to dwr-dev with what you are wanting to change to make sure it doesn't clash with some other work.</li>
<li>Make the changes and send a zipped patch to the mailing list describing what you've changed.</li>
<li>It's not worth applying through java.net for developer status, that method of getting involved doesn't work properly ,and requests always end up getting denied.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a number of existing DWR components that we are looking for maintainers for:</p>

<ul>
<li>JSF Integration</li>
<li>The Fluent Configuration System</li>
<li>Hibernate Integration</li>
<li>The Demo Webapp</li>
</ul>

<p>It would also be great to have a maintainer for DWR version 1.1, and maybe even 1.0. The workload for this is very low, but it might involve a bit of sudden very high priority work.</p>

<p>There are a number of areas of DWR that could do with improvement:</p>

<ul>
<li>Integration with other Ajax toolkits: Dojo, YUI, etc</li>
<li>Demo apps that show integration with: Spring, Struts, Webwork, etc</li>
</ul>

<p>And it's always good to have people that are keen on writing documentation or helping with sending out release announcements.</p>
