<h1>DOM Objects</h1>

<p>DWR automatically converts DOM trees from DOM, DOM4J, JDOM and XOM. You simply return a Document, Element or Node from any of the above and DWR will automatically convert it into a browser DOM object.</p>

<p>There is a common warning on startup about the JDOM converter, which you can safely ignore (unless you wanted to use JDOM):</p>

<p><code>INFO: Missing classdef for converter 'jdom'. Failed to load uk.ltd.getahead.dwr.convert.JDOMConverter. Cause: org/jdom/Document
</code></p>

<p>The problem is that DWR has no way of knowing if you wanted to use JDOM or not, so the message is at INFO level.</p>

<p>If you wanted to use JDOM you might be very pleased to know that the converter has not been able to load - which is why we've not taken the message away.</p>

<h3>exist-db.org</h3>

<p>I believe that DWR will work with exist-db out of the box, because builds on top of W3C DOM, which is supported.</p>
